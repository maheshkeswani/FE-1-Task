# Zepto Assignment

## SETUP
 
To get started and run the app:

Live Website : https://fe-1-task.vercel.app/

- Run ` yarn ` to install the corresponding node packages


- Run ` yarn start ` to run the app on http://localhost:3000

## FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE 

- When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear
- As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
- Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
- Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
- When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted

### TECHSTACK 

 - `REACTJS` , `TYPESCRIPT `, `TailWind CSS`
